# Automating-with-Dynamic-IDs-on-DocuSign-Form

This project is designed to automate the process of filling out DocuSign forms that use dynamic IDs. Dynamic IDs are generated by DocuSign and can change from one form to another, making it difficult to automate the process. This Python script uses a combination of web scraping and automation techniques to fill out these forms accurately and efficiently.

#Requirements
To run this script, you will need to install the following Python packages:

Selenium: pip install selenium
You will also need to download a web driver for the browser you want to use (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). The script is currently set up to use the Chrome driver, but you can easily change it to use another driver by modifying the driver variable in the script.

#Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

Run the python script. The script will open a new browser window and log in to your DocuSign account.

#Limitations
This script is designed to work with DocuSign forms that use dynamic IDs. If DocuSign changes their form structure, this script may not work as intended. Additionally, this script does not handle any CAPTCHAs or other security measures that may be in place on the form.
